    - "Everyone knows that debugging is twice as hard as writing a program in the first place. So if you're as clever as you can be when you write it, how will you ever debug it?"
    - "Don't comment bad code-rewrite it."
    - "C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big book."
    - "Do what you think is interesting, do something that you think is fun and worthwhile, because otherwise you won't do it well anyway."
    - "First is the sheer joy of making things. Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want others to use our work and to find it helpful."
    - "Nevertheless, C retains the basic philosophy that programmers know what they are doing; it only requires that they state their intentions explicitly."
    - "Controlling complexity is the essence of computer programming."
    - "The most effective debugging tool is still careful thought, coupled with judiciously placed print statements."
    - "Each new user of a new system uncovers a new class of bugs."
    - "90% of the functionality delivered now is better than 100% delivered never."
    - "Another effective technique is to explain your code to someone else. This will often cause you to explain the bug to yourself. Sometimes it takes no more than a few sentences, followed by an embarrassed \"Never mind, I see what's wrong. Sorry to bother you.\" This works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners. One university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk. Students with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor."

  quotes:
    - "When in doubt, use brute force."
    - "You can't trust code that you did not totally create yourself."
    - "If you want to go somewhere, `goto` is the best way to get there."
    - "That brings me to Dennis Ritchie. Our collaboration has been a thing of beauty."
    - "The press, television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz kids. (...) There is obviously a cultural gap. The act of breaking into a computer system has to have the same social stigma as breaking into a neighbor's house. It should not matter that the neighbor's door is unlocked."
    - "I've seen [visual] editors like that, but I don't feel a need for them. I don't want to see the state of the file when I'm editing."
    - "Unix was built for me. I didn't build it as an operating system for other people, I built it to do games, and to do my stuff. I was always into games, games was my thing. I used to play pinball machines, and I would pick the lock in the back of pinball machines. Then I'd study the diagrams that I had. That's where I learned a lot of this kind of logic."
    - "I think the major good idea in Unix was its clean and simple interface: open, close, read, and write."
    - "Unix was small, and you could go through it line by line and understand exactly how it worked. That was the origin of the so-called Unix culture."
    - "I think the open software movement (and Linux in particular) is laudable."
    - "I do believe that in a race, it is naive to think Linux has a hope of making a dent against Microsoft starting from way behind with a fraction of the resources and amateur labor. (I feel the same about Unix.)"
    - "I must say the Linux community is a lot nicer than the Unix community. A negative comment on Unix would warrant death threats. With Linux, it is like stirring up a nest of butterflies."
    - "I would try out the [C++] language [at AT&T] as it was being developed and make comments on it. It was part of the work atmosphere there. And you'd write something and then the next day it wouldn't work because the language changed. It was very unstable for a very long period of time. At some point, I said, no, no more. In an interview I said exactly that, that I didn't use it because it wouldn't stay still for two days in a row. When Stroustrup read the interview he came screaming into my room about how I was undermining him and what I said mattered and I said it was a bad language."
    - "[C++] certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it's a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it's just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it's personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it's not a good language to transport an algorithm-to say, \"I wrote it; here, take it.\" It's way too big, way too complex. And it's obviously built by a committee. Stroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used. And he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair. And he said \"no\" to no one. He put every feature in that language that ever existed. It wasn't cleanly designed-it was just the union of everything that came along. And I think it suffered drastically from that."
    - "When the three of us [Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer] got started, it was pure research. The three of us got together and decided that we hated C++. [laughter] ... [Returning to Go,] we started off with the idea that all three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was no extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason."

dennisritchie:
  name: "Dennis Ritchie"
  quotes:
    - "[C has] the power of assembly language and the convenience of ... assembly language. "
    - "UNIX is very simple, it just needs a genius to understand its simplicity."
    - "C is quirky, flawed, and an enormous success."
    - "Life's a bitch and then your feet wear down."
    - "Computer science research is different from these more traditional disciplines. Philosophically it differs from the physical sciences because it seeks not to discover, explain, or exploit the natural world, but instead to study the properties of machines of human creation. In this it as analogous to mathematics, and indeed the \"science\" part of computer science is, for the most part mathematical in spirit. But an inevitable aspect of computer science is the creation of computer programs: objects that, though intangible, are subject to commercial exchange."
    - "I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided. Linux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers."
    - "I think one of the interesting things about the Linux phenomenon is that [Linus] has been able to keep some kind of control over such an amazingly extended development environment. I'm certainly glad that I didn't have to develop C in public, because you get more suggestions than you really want. Being in this nice, small group, you can control that sort of thing. I honestly don't know the dynamics and the details of the Linux kernel project. However, one of the knocks on Linux is that it is undisciplined. But I think probably the fairer observation is that it is amazingly disciplined, compared to what you would expect, given the nature of the endeavor."
    - "I don't really distinguish between Linux and things that are more or less direct descendants of Unix. I think they're all the same at some level. Often, people ask me, \"Do you feel jealous about Linux being the big thing.\" And the answer is no, for the same reason. I think they're the same."
    - "C++ and Java, say, are presumably growing faster than plain C, but I bet C will still be around."
    - "For infrastructure technology, C will be hard to displace."
    - "Obviously, the person who had most influence on my career was Ken Thompson."
    - "When I read commentary about suggestions for where C should go, I often think back and give thanks that it wasn't developed under the advice of a worldwide crowd."

    - "It takes courage to love, but pain through love is the purifying fire which those who love generously know. We all know people who are so much afraid of pain that they shut themselves up like clams in a shell and, giving out nothing, receive nothing and therefore shrink until life is a mere living death."

    - "The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerated the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than the democratic state itself. That in its essence is fascism: ownership of government by an individual, by a group, or any controlling private power."
    - "Democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. The real safeguard of democracy, therefore, is education."

It is patriotic to support him insofar as he efficiently serves the country. It is unpatriotic not to oppose him to the exact extent that by inefficiency or otherwise he fails in his duty to stand by the country. In either event, it is unpatriotic not to tell the truth, whether about the president or anyone else."
