    - "If you love what you do and are willing to do what it takes, it's within your reach.\nAnd it'll be worth every minute you spend alone at night, thinking and thinking about what it is you want to design or build.\nIt'll be worth it, I promise."

    - "I wish to God that Apple and Google were partners in the future."

Sorry to bother you.\"\nThis works remarkably well; you can even use non-programmers as listeners.\nOne university computer center kept a teddy bear near the help desk.\nStudents with mysterious bugs were required to explain them to the bear before they could speak to a human counselor."

    - "I must say the Linux community is a lot nicer than the Unix community.\nA negative comment on Unix would warrant death threats.\nWith Linux, it is like stirring up a nest of butterflies."
    - "I would try out the [C++] language [at AT&T] as it was being developed and make comments on it.\nIt was part of the work atmosphere there.\nAnd you'd write something and then the next day it wouldn't work because the language changed.\nIt was very unstable for a very long period of time.\nAt some point, I said, no, no more.\nIn an interview I said exactly that, that I didn't use it because it wouldn't stay still for two days in a row.\nWhen Stroustrup read the interview he came screaming into my room about how I was undermining him and what I said mattered and I said it was a bad language."
    - "[C++] certainly has its good points.\nBut by and large I think it's a bad language.\nIt does a lot of things half well and it's just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive.\nEverybody I know, whether it's personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different.\nSo it's not a good language to transport an algorithm-to say, \"I wrote it; here, take it.\"\nIt's way too big, way too complex.\nAnd it's obviously built by a committee.\nStroustrup campaigned for years and years and years, way beyond any sort of technical contributions he made to the language, to get it adopted and used.\nAnd he sort of ran all the standards committees with a whip and a chair.\nAnd he said \"no\" to no one.\nHe put every feature in that language that ever existed.\nIt wasn't cleanly designed - it was just the union of everything that came along.\nAnd I think it suffered drastically from that."
    - "When the three of us [Thompson, Rob Pike, and Robert Griesemer] got started, it was pure research.\nThe three of us got together and decided that we hated C++. [laughter] ...\n[Returning to Go,] we started off with the idea that all three of us had to be talked into every feature in the language, so there was no extraneous garbage put into the language for any reason."

    - "Computer science research is different from these more traditional disciplines.\nPhilosophically it differs from the physical sciences because it seeks not to discover, explain, or exploit the natural world, but instead to study the properties of machines of human creation.\nIn this it as analogous to mathematics, and indeed the \"science\" part of computer science is, for the most part mathematical in spirit.\nBut an inevitable aspect of computer science is the creation of computer programs: objects that, though intangible, are subject to commercial exchange."
    - "I think the Linux phenomenon is quite delightful, because it draws so strongly on the basis that Unix provided.\nLinux seems to be the among the healthiest of the direct Unix derivatives, though there are also the various BSD systems as well as the more official offerings from the workstation and mainframe manufacturers."
    - "I think one of the interesting things about the Linux phenomenon is that [Linus] has been able to keep some kind of control over such an amazingly extended development environment.\nI'm certainly glad that I didn't have to develop C in public, because you get more suggestions than you really want.\nBeing in this nice, small group, you can control that sort of thing.\nI honestly don't know the dynamics and the details of the Linux kernel project.\nHowever, one of the knocks on Linux is that it is undisciplined.\nBut I think probably the fairer observation is that it is amazingly disciplined, compared to what you would expect, given the nature of the endeavor."
    - "I don't really distinguish between Linux and things that are more or less direct descendants of Unix.\nI think they're all the same at some level.\nOften, people ask me, \"Do you feel jealous about Linux being the big thing.\"\nAnd the answer is no, for the same reason. I think they're the same."
    - "C++ and Java, say, are presumably growing faster than plain C, but I bet C will still be around."
    - "For infrastructure technology, C will be hard to displace."
    - "Obviously, the person who had most influence on my career was Ken Thompson."
    - "When I read commentary about suggestions for where C should go, I often think back and give thanks that it wasn't developed under the advice of a worldwide crowd."
